## 📌 Project Overview

Plant diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity and farmer income. Traditional disease identification methods rely on manual inspection, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and often inaccessible in rural areas.

This project provides a web-based AI solution that integrates deep learning models with an intuitive user interface to detect tomato leaf diseases efficiently and accurately.
